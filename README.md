Hi there! I'm Haydn, a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania in [Jacob Gardner's](https://jacobrgardner.github.io) lab. My research focuses on applying machine learning to scientific problems, particularly in drug discovery and pharmaceutical applications.

My interests include generative modeling, Bayesian optimization, and representation learning.
